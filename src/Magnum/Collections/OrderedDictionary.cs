	/// OrderedDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; is a collection that maps keys of type TKey
	/// to values of type TValue. The keys are maintained in a sorted order, and at most one value
	/// is permitted for each key.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <p>The keys are compared in one of three ways. If TKey implements IComparable&lt;TKey&gt; or IComparable,
	/// then the CompareTo method of that interface will be used to compare elements. Alternatively, a comparison
	/// function can be passed in either as a delegate, or as an instance of IComparer&lt;TKey&gt;.</p>
	/// <p>OrderedDictionary is implemented as a balanced binary tree. Inserting, deleting, and looking up an
	/// an element all are done in log(N) type, where N is the number of keys in the tree.</p>
	/// <p><see cref="Dictionary{TKey,TValue}"/> is similar, but uses hashing instead of comparison, and does not maintain
	/// the keys in sorted order.</p>
